# How Do I Use It?

## Define the entities model in DHF

Pipes creates custom step code for your MarkLogic DataHub flows.

Let's create a custom code which will read in sample customer records and produce instances of Customer and Address entities, based on this data.

As a basis, we'll use a sample DHF project defined in [Examples/Customer360](https://github.com/marklogic-community/pipes/tree/master/Examples/Customer360).

If we deploy this project on a MarkLogic server and run DHF QS UI, we'll see the definition of Customer and Address entities, like below:

## Create the flow

## Add ingest and custom steps

## Ingest data

## Build a graph in Pipes for the custom step using ingested data

## Save the custom step code from Pipes into the DHF project

## Run the custom step
