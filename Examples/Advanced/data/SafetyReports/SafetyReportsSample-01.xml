				<narrativeincludeclinical>This is a literature report from the Japanese Journal of Psychiatric Treatment 2015, 30 (3); p415-419 entitled "Two Cases of Chronic Somatic Pain Successfully Treated with Duloxetine".This is the Case No. 2. No adverse event due to Pfizer products occurred in the Case 1.An 80-year-old female patient started to receive pregabalin (product name unknown) oral from an unspecified date at 75 mg, daily for neuropathic pain. Co-suspect drugs included paroxetine hydrochloride (product name unknown) for depression, (LOXOPROFEN) at 180 mg/day for right shoulder pain, paracetamol (ACETAMINOPHEN) at 600 mg/day for neuropathic pain, duloxetine 20 mg/day. Medical history included depression. Concomitant medication included felbinac 70 mg/day for external use.The patient experienced drug-induced ileus on an unspecified date with outcome of recovered. The action taken in response to the event for pregabalin was permanently withdrawn.The patient was an 80-year-old woman.Chief complaint: Right shoulder painMedical history: DepressionHistory of present illness: Since around the spring of year X-2, the patient noticed such symptoms as fatigueability, mental concentration decreased and sleep loss without any particular inducing factors. On 26JulX-2, the patient visited the author's hospital as an outpatient basis. She was given a diagnosis of depression and prescribed sulpiride 50 mg/day, zolpidem 5 mg/day and ethyl loflazepate 1 mg/day, but the symptoms hardly improved. On 04AugX-2, the patient was admitted to the author's hospital. Treatment with paroxetine was started and after about a half year of treatment, depression remitted.Subsequent clinical course: In around SepX, pushing a walker for an aged person in the hospital triggered right shoulder pain that gradually worsened. Chest X-ray in the author's hospital showed no fracture. Treatment with topical felbinac 70 mg/day and oral loxoprofen 180 mg/day was started for pain, but no therapeutic effect was shown after all. Hematological/biochemical tests, thyroid function test, electrocardiography, chest X-ray, head CT scanning, and electroencephalography were performed just in case, but no abnormality was observed in each test. Therefore, the patient was referred to a pain clinic, where "a possibility of pain similar to complex regional pain syndrome" was diagnosed, thus stellate ganglion block was periodically started. In around FebX+1, the patient also began to complain of posterior cervical pain. In the pain clinic, she was told "the symptom might be associated with neuropathic pain due to spondylosis" and oral treatment with pregabalin 75 mg/day and acetaminophen 600 mg/day was started in addition to the star nerve block performed as before. However, the pain did not so much improve.In early JulX+1, duloxetine was added at 20 mg/day with the dose gradually increased every two weeks up to 60 mg/day. In the middle AugX+1, the patient reported that "pain had improved by 90%". While the scores of HAM-D (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) and MPQ (MacGill Pain Questionnaire) were 6 points and 32 points, respectively before introduction of duloxetine, HAM-D improved to 2 points and MPQ to 9 points. However, in OctX+1, ileus developed and in the end of OctX+1, the patient was transferred to hospital B. In the hospital, drug-induced ileus was pointed out; all the oral drugs were discontinued. In NovX+1, as ileus improved, the patient was transferred back to the author's hospital, but at that time, chronic pain as well as mood disorder was not observed. However, in early DecX+1, although mood disorder was not observed, the patient again began to complain of right upper arm pain. HAM-D was 3 points and MPQ was 21 points. The patient, who recognized the effects of duloxetine on pain during the previous treatment, gave consent to resuming the oral treatment. On the following day, treatment with duloxetine was started at 20 mg/day and two weeks later, the dose was gradually increased to 40 mg/day. Right upper arm pain subsequently significantly improved to the level before the patient was transferred. In FebX+2 (two months after the restart of treatment with duloxetine), HAM-D improved to 2 points and MPQ to 11 points.Pfizer is Marketing Authorization Holder of pregabalin, paroxetine hydrochloride in the reporter's country. This may be a duplicate report in situations where another Marketing Authorization Holder of pregabalin, paroxetine hydrochloride has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.No follow-up attempts needed. No further information expected.</narrativeincludeclinical>

				<senderdiagnosis/>
				<sendercomment>Causality cannot be excluded for the serious event drug-induced ileus and both Pfizer suspect drugs paroxetine and pregabalin, in this 80-year-old female patient. No detailed information on the event is available, at this time. Medical history only included depression. Pregabalin was prescribed for neuropathic pain due to spondylosis. Patient also received the non-Pfizer co-suspect products duloxetine, loxoprofen and paracetamol.The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer products is evaluated as part  of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including  the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.</sendercomment>
