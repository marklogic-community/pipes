				<narrativeincludeclinical>Manufacturer Control Number: 2015-11646This spontaneous literature case from Japan was reported by a physician via license partner and was initially received on 04-Mar-2015. It concerns a 72-year-old male patient (height and weight unknown).The patient's medical history and concurrent conditions included pain, spinal osteoarthritis and gait disturbance. The patient's history of drug abuse/illicit drug use, alcohol and smoking was not reported.The patient was treated with tramadol hydrochloride, paracetamol (Tramcet, film-coated tablet, oral) 1 df 2/day initiated on an unspecified date for pain.No other suspected medication was reported.No relevant concomitant medication was reported.On an unspecified date, the patient experienced withdrawal syndrome.It was reported that on an unspecified date, the patient was diagnosed with difficulty in walking due to osteoarthritis of lumbar spine and was prescribed tramadol/apap, for approximately 6 months at the previous hospital. However, the symptoms did not improve, for which he was referred to the author's hospital.On an unspecified date, he complained of severe clinical symptoms compared with imaging findings, based on which a high risk for abuse of/dependence on the opioid analgesic was considered. Accordingly, switching to buprenorphine patch was suggested. At the same time that application of buprenorphine patch was started, tramadol/apap was discontinued because the dose of oral tramadol/apap was low.However, the patient experienced irritated feeling, epigastric discomfort and yawning and became sweaty approximately 8 hours after the application of buprenorphine, base on which withdrawal signs were considered, and tramadol/apap was resumed immediately. As a result, the symptoms disappeared. The patient had recovered from withdrawal reaction on an unspecified date.No relevant laboratory data were reported.No treatment of the AE was reported.The outcome of withdrawal syndrome was reported as recovered/resolved.No further information was available.Literature citation:takemura m. experience of two cases presenting with withdrawal signs due to interruption of oral treatment with weak opioid. abstract of congress. 2015; 28:101:***Third party case numbers:e2b company number: jp-jnjfoc-20150306429</narrativeincludeclinical>

				<senderdiagnosis/>
				<sendercomment>Withdrawal syndrome is assessed as serious.Withdrawal syndrome is listed in the Company Core Data Sheet of tramadol hydrochloride, paracetamol (oral) and unlisted in the Company Core Data Sheet of buprenorphine (transdermal).Withdrawal syndrome is assessed to be possibly related to the administration of tramadol hydrochloride, paracetamol and unlikely related to buprenorphine.The information in this single case does not appear to alter the favorable benefit to risk ratio of tramadol hydrochloride, paracetamol nor buprenorphine transdermal.The additionally reported events of irritated feeling, epigastric discomfort, yawning and sweaty were deleted as they are considered to be symptoms of the diagnosed withdrawal.Based on the available information, time to onset is plausible, and withdrawal syndrome belongs to the known reaction pattern of tramadol hydrochloride, paracetamol. According to the reporter, the withdrawal symptoms occurred after discontinuation of tramadol hydrochloride, paracetamol, and the event resolved after reintroducing tramadol hydrochloride, paracetamol. Hence, withdrawal syndrome is assessed to be possibly related to the administration of tramadol hydrochloride, paracetamol.Buprenorphine, which was started on the day of the withdrawal reaction as replacement therapy for tramadol hydrochloride, paracetamol, was also captured as a suspect drug. As tramadol hydrochloride, paracetamol is known to possibly induce withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation, the company considered withdrawal syndrome to be unlikely related to the administration of buprenorphine.</sendercomment>
