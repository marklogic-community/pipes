# Pipes for MarkLogic DataHub

## What is it?
A visual programming tool for [MarkLogic](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/getting-started/intro). It integrates with the [MarkLogic Data Hub](https://docs.marklogic.com/datahub/) and produces the code for a [Custom Step](https://docs.marklogic.com/datahub/modules/editing-custom-step-module.html) using a no-code UI environment.

Pipes for MarkLogic DataHub is a community tool. As such, it is not supported by MarkLogic Corporation and is only updated and corrected based on a best-effort approach. Any contribution or feedback is welcomed to make the tool better.
