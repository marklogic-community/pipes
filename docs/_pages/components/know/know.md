# Know

A simple graph viewer to visualize graphs and relationships in a data hub and understand context.

### Getting Started

Know allows you to search across the triples in the data hub databases.  Where Explore shows the graph across documents and Semantics triples, Know is visualizing Semantics triples only.  You can load triples from anywhere into the data hub and start searching and traversing the graph of connected data.
